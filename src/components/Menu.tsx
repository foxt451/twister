    Basically, how many keys your keyboard is capable of handling simulatenously
    (yes, there is often a limit, mine has 3, some can have even 2). There will
    be no more than this many keys for you to press. Select 2 and you'll be safe!

    <i>
      A keyboard with n-key rollover, or abbreviated as NKRO, has the ability to
      scan each button press individually, as opposed to having the PC do it. As
      a result, every pressed button, or key, is noted, even if youâ€™re pressing
      a bunch of keys simultaneously. Sometimes you'll see the "n" in n-key
      rollover replaced with a number. That number tells you how many keys you
      can press simultaneously with the keyboard being aware. For example, if
      your keyboard has 6-key rollover, you can press six keys at once with
      successful input. N-key rollover is particularly relevant/helpful for
      gaming keyboards.
